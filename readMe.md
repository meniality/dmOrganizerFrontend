WHAT THE APP DOES:
    The DM orgainzer is an app that allows the user to organize any world that they can imagaine. They can do this by logging into their account and creating a new campaign. Within this campaign the user can create cards. These cards can be anything the user needs, a planet, a continent, a region, a city, etc. After creation these cards can be linked to each other via parent and child relationships. This allows the user to see for example, that a city belongs to a cetain region. In turn that region belongs to a certain continent, that continent in on a certain planet. etc. Any number of relationships can be made between cards.
